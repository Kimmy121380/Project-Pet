<div class="zoro">
<p id ="zoro">
Zoro is a cat. He has one eye blind but this minor impairment has not decreased his cuteness by one bit. He cries like a baby distinguishing himself from the rest of the feline family. Other than being a lovely company to human, he is also fond of massaging human feet in bed. A can of tuna fish lures him to the table while he was in hiding. He also spits out furballs sometimes. Before he was really old, he tends to hide in the houses and you don't really see him often. But after he started living with Kimmy, he becomes a lot more socialable and hung out with crowds and sometimes said hi to the dogs when he passes by. Zoro smells like cleanax and all sorts of toiletries because that is the smell of his litterbox. He also likes hiding in beds and stay there whole day. It is always a pleasant to have Zoro smudge your face in the morning. He has a butthole resembling the shape of a flower. It has made many featured appearance on Ariana's notebook.

<div class="biko"> 
<p  id="biko">
Biko is a German Shepherd. He has a huge head and long nose. He doesn't like anyone touching his paws and butthole. When you walk into the house, it is very likely he will poke your butt with his long nose and wiggle his tail to smack your legs by accident. When he pees uncontrolably on the floor, it usually creates a puddle. Fighting Bo and biting each other's heads have kept him occupied. Be careful when you are at a fire place with Biko because he might swipe his tail over the fire and be lit. Also wear shoes around him because he might drop a heavy log on your toes.

<div class="aoife">
<p id="aoife">
Aoife is a dog that resembles a sea urchin. She has heart murmur and a bad leg. She is basically blind and deaf towards the end of her life. She loves sitting on pillows and people's laps. Compared to Biko, she pees and poops in tiny portions. Her hair is fuzzy and black. Her eyes are green in the dark and murky. She has a diffcult time to get on top of the couches due to the shortness of her legs. Stitches on her head is the evidence that she had a brain surgery once. Leaves get stuck around her mouth and make her look like a vagabond. But she is loved no matter how untraditional her look may be.

<div class="bo">
<p id="bo">
Bo is a black mixed-breed dog. He is found to have nascent diabetes hence he has a hard time to hold his pee. He likes staying in his crate and stayed away from men. After he started to receive insulin shots, he became more social around people. Bo has eaten many trash and leftover from a scavenger hunt of trashcan or around the house. He has eaten people's socks many times and had to go to a vet to retrieve the treasures stored in his stomache. He might have a weird fetish with Sheppard's stinky socks as the socks of entrapment were often his. His fur is always greasy but surprisingly Bo's body smell is tolerable and he is polite enough to not stink people with his breath like many other dogs might have.

<div class="oops">
<p id="oops">
The author of this website has very limited knowledge about this cat. She is black and hides all the time but liked sleeping with Mr.Somers and Fiona for some reason. One time she was trapped in the bathroom with Kimmy.

<div class="sally">
<p id="sally">
Sally is a dainty Golden Doodle. She has aged fairly well. Sometimes she has stinky ears that means she has an infection. Sally has long, slim limbs and a vigorous tail. Her cuteness is largely dependent on her haircut at times. Buster is her bestie. Her favorite snack is the fake bones and she chews it to its limit and would never let it go.

<div class="buster">
<p id="buster">
When you look at him, Buster may present himself as a cute, little winer dog who has a long sausage body. However, in reality, Buster is an old, star-eyed granpa who could not stop eating as long as there is still food. His fur is smoothe and beautiful like caramel. He deserves everything in the world. A few rice cakes wouldn't hurt too much. His waist size has fluctuated over time due to doctor's advice. If any dog needs to read Aristotle on Gold Balance, Buster should be the first one.

<div class="mimi">
	<p id="mimi">
Mimi is a cat. Once suspected to be a Devon Rex as an undeveloped stray cat, he has proven to be a more aggressive breed over time. His eyes are green like jade. Amongst his many talents, opening water faucet and pulling washing machine's tubes to flood Kimmy's balcony for a number of times are the most memorable. Though being naughty, he is moderate with his eating. Unlike many other cats, eels and crab meat have eluded his attention, yet fried chicken bone scored his choice of favor. Showers have not salvaged the fate of his white fur turning yellow. He passed away on a very cold day of winter. The loss is more than words and tears.

<div class="frankie">
<p id="frankie">
Frankie is a yellow rotund cat that was imported from Puerto Rico. He was rescued from Puerto Rico first then from Long Beach and finally now has found his favorite residence, the fireside. He looks a loaf of bread most of the time with his hands tucked under his chest. He has bright blue eyes like Frank Sinatra that gives origin to his name. He loves belly rubs and purrs like a motorcycle from 1960s.
